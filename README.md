# MERN Stack Todo List

This project is a simple Todo List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It covers all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities and includes a feature to mark tasks as complete without deleting them from the database. The application displays a form on the left to add or update tasks and a list of tasks on the right fetched from the database.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new tasks to the database.
- **Read:** Display the list of tasks from the database.
- **Update:** Edit existing tasks.
- **Delete:** Remove tasks from the database.
- **Mark Complete:** Mark tasks as complete with a tickable area without removing them.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Setup environment variables:**
Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
Must create a MongoDB Database to get string.

3. **Backend:**

4. **Frontend:**
cd frontend
npm start


## Future Enhancements

This project was created to practice working with APIs and full stack development using MERN stack.
Basic styling and React elements are used in this project.
Future updates will include improved styling and backend functionalities.
