# MERN Stack Todo List

This project is a simple Todo List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It covers all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities and includes a feature to mark tasks as complete without deleting them from the database. The application displays a form on the left to add or update tasks and a list of tasks on the right fetched from the database.
